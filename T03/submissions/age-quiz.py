"""This code will:
1) take in a userâ€™s age and store it in an integer variable called age
2) output a variety of responses determined by the data the user enters,
- If the user is 40 or over, output the message "You're over the hill."
- Assume that the oldest someone can be is 100; if the user enters a
higher number, output the message "Sorry, you're dead.".
- If the user is 65 or older, output the message "Enjoy your retirement!"
- If the user is under 13, output the message "You qualify for the kiddie
discount."
- If the user is 21, output the message "Congrats on your 21st!"
- For any other age, output the message "Age is but a number."
