"""
The following code will:
1) Declare the following variables:
    num1 = 99.23
    num2 = 23
    num3 = 150
    string1 = “100”
2) convert them as follows:
    num1 into an integer
    num2 into a float
    num3 into a String
    string1 into an integer
3) print out all the variables on separate lines
